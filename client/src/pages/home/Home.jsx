          <h2>We Believe We Can Solve The Education Issues In Our Lifetime</h2>
          <p>
            Education plays a vital role in human capital formation. It raises
            the productivity and efficiency of individuals and thus produces
            skilled manpower that is capable of leading the economy towards the
            path of sustainable economic development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Education is expected to act positively towards world economic
            development and poverty alleviation, both of which are the
            priorities of the world community. An investment in human capital,
            especially in education allows each person to contribute to their
            society in a productive way.
